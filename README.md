# PEF-RISC-V
The goal of this project is to influence the RISC-V open source community and potentially IBM Cloud by creating a the first VM-based TEE for the RISC-V processor.  IBM is beginning to incorporate RISC-V into its server chips and other devices/systems.  The target environments for the VM-based TEEs are cloud and edge computing.  This project is part of Research Challenge 5120.
